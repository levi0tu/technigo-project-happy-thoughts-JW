# Happy Thoughts

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- This assignment is to build an app like X that fetches data from an API and also posts.
It will look as close as possible as the provided example.
- I will start with fetching the latest posts, defining the order.
- After that I will setup the POST request.
- Lastly I will work on the styling and CSS.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
